# Image-Stitching
In this project, I have implemented image stitching.
I have selected two images that have the same background but different foreground. 
I have implemented image stitching where I eliminate the foreground objects that move in the scene. 

### This project was a part of my coursework at the University at Buffalo for the course Computer Vision and Image Processing.
